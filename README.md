## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

How I built this project is inspired by the 'accessible toggle' that I found while I was working on the project that has toggle button, of which the radio buttons are hidden by setting:

```
opacity: 0;
```

Instead of

```
display: none;
```

In this way, the radio buttons can still be navigated via arrow key.
